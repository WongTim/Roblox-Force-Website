# Roblox-Force-Website
A fan page written in Python Flask and HTML illustrating a fictional group, Roblox Force. The website comes with multiple interactive activities to engage the user and can even track their progress

# Home Page
You will be treated to the main page of the website introducing the group, our activities and some fun moments in-game. There will also be social media links such as Instagram so that you will be able to check out the social media page of Roblox Force!

There is a checkbox here where you can raise feedback for this website.

# Members
In this page, you will be able to see the 4 members of Roblox Force. They have customisable portraits representing them. Clicking on their portraits will bring you to their bio and some of their interests, as well as their wardrobe. Some of them are unavailable by default and you will need to punch in a code to unlock them. Once you have done so, you can even set those outfits as the characters' portrait
