The character's page has bio and some of their interests, as well as their other costumes that they wear. 

## Character outfits
Upon arriving at the Other Costumes section for the members, you are shown three alternate outfits from their inventory. Clicking on them allows you to see the contents of said costume.

Some of them are unavailable by default and you will need to punch in a code to unlock them. Once you have done so, you can even set those outfits as the characters' portrait.

## Changing portraits of character with their outfit
Clicking on an outfit allows you to see the contents of it. Additionally you will notice there is an equip button at the bottom of the page

Clicking on "Equip" will replace the character's portrait in the Members Page with this outfit
